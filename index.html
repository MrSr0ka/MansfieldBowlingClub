    <h1>WELCOME</h1>
    <p>We completed the purchase of the former Mansfield Bowling Club site with a view of submitting a fresh<br>
        planning application that is more in line with the aspirations of the local community.</p>
    <p class="after-line">Since then, we have consulted local residents on their prioritise and concerns regarding the site’s future development and provided<br> updates on the designs as they have progressed through winter 2020 and spring 2021.</p>
    <p class="title">Have Your Say</p>
    <p>Together with Wolff Architects and Andy Sturgeon Design, we are pleased to present our proposed scheme that we hope to<br> submit to the London Borough of Camden soon.</p>
    <p>These proposals take feedback into account from all local residents, and will provide a care home facility which includes:</p>
    <ul><li>A community garden, orchard, and allotment space</li>
    <li>Children’s play area and rain garden</li>
<li>Arrival and drop-off space accessed via Croftdown Road</li>
<li>A tranquillity garden and seating area</li>
<li>A separate residents’ courtyard nestled within the buildings</li>
<li>Three tennis courts for community use</li>
<li>A tennis pavilion to support the site’s history of sporting use</li>
<li>A sustainable build utilising solar panels, increased energy efficiency, and better biodiversity</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find a presentation of the scheme <a href="https://mansfieldbowlingclub.info/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1962-PL-Presentation-Boards.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>Please feel free to email any feedback to: <strong>mansfieldbowlingclub@kandaconsulting.co.uk</strong></p>
<p><strong>Previous Consultation</strong></p>
<p>We hosted our first residents' meeting with immediate neighbours of the site on Tuesday 10th November. Thank you to those that <br>participated.

<p>A second meeting with a broader group of residents and community groups was held on Thursday 26th November. The report<br> can be found <a href="https://mansfieldbowlingclub.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mansfield-Bowling-Club-Second-Residents-Meeting-Summary.pdf">here</a> and a copy of the presentation <a href="https://mansfieldbowlingclub.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mansfield-Bowling-Club-Second-Residents-Meeting-Presentation_261120.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>A survey of residents was held in December 2020.</p>
<p>Sessions with local residents and community groups were held in spring 2021 – a copy of the presentation can be found here -<br> before the project team began detailed design work on the care home facility scheme that we hope to submit to the London<br> Borough of Camden soon.</p>
